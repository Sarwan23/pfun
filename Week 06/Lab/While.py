'''
To get started with PyCharm, let’s write a Python script.

Let’s start our project: if you’re on the Welcome screen, click Create New Project.
 If you’ve already got a project open, choose File | New Project.
Choose the project location.
Then click the Create button at the bottom of the New Project dialog.
Creating a Python file

Select the project root and click right mouse button
Choose the option Python file from the pop-up window, and then type the new file name 'Square'.

PyCharm creates a new Python file and opens it for editing.

Copy the content of this file in to Square.py and run it.


The temperature was reported as going down each day, so we want to know the first day that it went up.
The temperature and the weather condition for each day are what the program has to read and it has to report the
temperature and the weather condition for the day when the temperature dipped to a minimum before it went up.

'''
i = 1
print('Here are the first 5 powers of 2: ')
while (i < 5):

    print(i*i)
    i = i + 1

#Exercise 1:
#===========
#Change the code above such that it will print the square of first 7 numbers.
#Change the code above such that it will print the sum of squares of first 7 numbers.

#Exercise 2:
#===========
#Change the code above such that it will read temperature (in Fahrenheit) of 7 days
#and compute the average temperature of the week.


#Exercise 3:
#===========
#Change the code above such that it will convert the temperature of each day from Fahrenheit
#to celcius.

#Using return statement:
#=======================
#Exercise 4:
#===========
#Write a function 'fahrenheit_to_celcuis(temp)' that will take 'temp' parameter(temp -> temperature in Fahrenheit)
#and convert it in to celcius.
# [Important : define the function at the top of this file]
#Change the code above such that while loop block should call this function for the temperature conversion of each day
#and compute the average temperature of the week in celcius.
