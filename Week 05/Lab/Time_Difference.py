#Keep asking user until the user enters valid time.

#Valid value for hours are between 0 to 24.
#Valid value for minutes are between 0 to 60.
#Valid value for minutes are between 0 to 60.

#Lab Exercise 2:
#==============
#Implement the functions given above.
#Print the converted time in USA , Australia , Afghanistan
